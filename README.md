# Plat4m

Plat4m is a simple runtime system platform scouting and support library specially intended to 
be used with other Ruby projects to provide light weight runtime system detection and provide 
support for simple system package management (install/uninstall) support.

Plat4m is definitely not intended as a full fledged runtime system detection system and/or a 
complete system management solution.
